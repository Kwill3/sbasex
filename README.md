## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS / SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Web Design
- Javascript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Hooks for state
- React Router for navigation

### What I learned

- React Router to serve the different pages when clicked from the Navigation Bar.

- Different ways to add hover functionality, especially NavLink and active class.

- Using React Hooks to render different pages according to data.json file.

- Using multiple classes on an element to set it as the default element.

### Useful resources

- [React Router Tutorial](https://reactrouterdotcom.fly.dev/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial) - This documentation explains how to implement React Router v6.
- [React Hooks useState](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6P86uwfdR0) - This video sums up the useState functionality in React Hooks neatly, it was very easy for me to understand and start using right away.
